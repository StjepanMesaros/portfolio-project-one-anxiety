                <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
                <p>Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a
                    therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety.

                    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety
                    disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve
                    your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.

                    CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that
                    triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety
                    symptoms.

                <h2>Medications</h2>
                <p>
                    Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety
                    disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example:
                    certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders and an anti-anxiety medication
                    called buspirone may be prescribed.
