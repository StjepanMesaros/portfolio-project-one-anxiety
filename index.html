            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders
                frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often,
                anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror
                that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks).
                These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out
                of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to
                prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into
                adulthood.
                Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social
                phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder.
                Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you
                have, treatment can help.
